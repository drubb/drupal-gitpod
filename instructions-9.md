# Welcome to Drupal 9 on Gitpod

You Drupal 9 instance is being prepared, this will take some time.
You can watch the progress in the terminal window below ("Start & Run").

As soon as the installation is finished you'll be prompted to open the
server port, either in your browser or in the preview panel.

There's also a Drush one-time link to login into your site.
